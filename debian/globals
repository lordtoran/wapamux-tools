DESCRIPTION="Script toolchain for mass naming and remuxing of anime and TV episodes
 wapamux-tools provides a set of handy shell scripts for making the mass naming and tagging of anime and TV episodes a lot easier.
 .
  * wapaname: A semi-automated frontend for tvnamer.
  * wapamux: Converts or remuxes (based on an mkvmerge option file) video files into a subdirectory.
  * wapasplit: Splits a set of video files into subdirectories by metadata CRC.
 .
 Output is always in Matroska (.mkv) format.
 .
 Note that the scripts are deliberately intended for per-directory semi-automation only, without a true batch mode. The motivation behind this is the sensible handling of anime seasons put together from different encodes."
